# Welcome to Lumen!

<img src="./_static/diagram.svg" width="100%">

The Lumen project provides a framework to build data-driven dashboards
from a simple yaml specification. It is designed to query data from
any source, filter it in various ways and then provide views of that
information, which can be anything from a simple indicator to a table
or a plot.

Since Lumen is built on [Panel](https://panel.holoviz.org) it supports
a wide range of plotting libraries and other components to explore and
visualize data. Thanks to integration with
[Intake](https://intake.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a lightweight
package for finding, investigating, loading and disseminating data,
Lumen can query data from a wide range of sources including many file
formats such as CSV or Parquet but also SQL and many others.

Lumen is organized into a small number of simple object types which
can be easily subclassed and extended:

* `Source`: A `Source` provides any number of tables along with a JSON schema describing the contents of those tables.
* `Filter`: A `Filter` object is given the schema of a field in one of the tables and generates queries which filter the data supplied by a `Source`.
* `View`: A `View` can query a table from a `Source` and generates a viewable representation.
* `Transform`: A `Transform` can apply arbitrary transformation to the tables.
