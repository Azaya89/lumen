# Lumen compared to other dashboarding tools

Here we will first talk about the most fundamental differences that set Lumen apart from other tools, and then compare Lumen to specific competitive or complementary tools so that it is clear how Lumen fits in.

## General considerations

As listed at [pyviz.org/tools](https://pyviz.org/tools.html#dashboarding) and [pyviz.org/dashboarding](https://pyviz.org/dashboarding/), there are many other Python-based open-source tools for building analytics dashboards. There are even more if you consider commercial tools or ones not based on Python, such as the hundreds of listed at [capterra](https://www.capterra.com/dashboard-software/). How can you choose between Lumen and all these other tools?

What sets Lumen apart is that it lets _anyone_ on your team make apps that build on custom Python code, without requiring that _everyone_ learn Python. Lumen is a great choice if you have some people on a team or in an organization who can write custom Python code that does _precisely_ what your organization needs in a particular case, whether that's connecting to some custom data source, applying some custom transform or analysis method, viewing things in some custom chart or type of table, or literally anything else you can do in Python (which is literally anything!). Ideally those Python programmers will be using the Python ecosystem to do their daily work, using tools like those from [HoloViz](https://holoviz.org), and when they build custom functionality for their own work, that same functionality can be made available to non-Python users. That way everyone in the organization can benefit from all of the innovation being developed.

Of course, traditional BI analytics tools like Tableau, PowerBI, or Superset also let non-technical or non-Python users with domain knowledge build visualizations and dashboards. These longer-established BI tools will generally have a more polished and friendly user interface than Lumen has, meeting more of the needs of less-technical users with no coding at all. If those tools do what's required, use them!

But what do you do when you reach the limits of those tools? Many of them do include Python or other scripting tools for that purpose, but generally as an add-on that's not fully integrated. Unlike those other tools, Lumen itself is built directly on the scientific Python stack, such as the Intake and Panel libraries, which lets Lumen (a) provide a very rich basis of functionality to non-technical users comparable to what is available to Python users, and (b) treat custom functionality as a "first class citizen", provided exactly the same way as any of Lumen's native functionality. That way an organization can customize _anything_, with new customizations requiring Python code contributed by the Python experts and then immediately usable by _every_ Lumen user, technical or not.

Lumen and the rest of the HoloViz and scientific Python stack can are thus designed to meet _all_ of the needs of an organization, no matter how specialized or esoteric those needs are. By design, standard BI tools will do a great job at the typical needs common across a market segment, but won't do as well at providing "headroom" or a "release valve" for those rarer but individually important bits that can otherwise dominate a workflow or greatly reduce its effectiveness.


## [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com), [PowerBI](https://powerbi.microsoft.com), [Looker](https://looker.com), [Spotfire](https://www.tibco.com/products/tibco-spotfire), etc.

The leading commercial dashboarding tools focus first on providing an intuitive, full-featured user interface for building apps without explicit coding, which makes them good choices for the needs of less-technical users. Unlike open-source tools like Lumen, they also include commercial support, which again can be important for the same audience. They also provide a wide swath of out-of-the-box data integrations, which can save a lot of development time for accessing supported data sources. When you reach the limits of the already-provided functionality, these tools even let you provide custom Python code that you can integrate into your applications. Finally, the tools generally include deployment platforms so that users can share deployed apps with each other in the organization, while Lumen apps need a separate deployment system.

So what's the catch (besides the cost)? Depends on your organization's mix of data science and analytics teams. If you have an organization dominated by non-technical analytics users, plus maybe a few Python programmers, then you can make good use of the commercial tools plus a little bit of customization on the side as needed, with everything organized around the commercial tool. Lumen is designed for the opposite situation: it makes the power available in the Python open-source ecosystem, and makes much of it available immediately (plus almost anything else available with small customizations) to non-technical users. So Lumen is a good choice when you want to make sure your Python-based data-science team can have an impact across your organization, with them (not the commercial tool vendors!) owning the process of analytics and visualization in your organization, either directly (in Jupyter Notebooks, Panel or Voila apps, etc.) or by making functionality available to all through Lumen. The Python users can use everything through Python and Jupyter, and then those same components can be available to non-technical users via Lumen. This way requirements and domain-specific ideas can flow freely towards the data-science team, while Python solutions can flow freely out from the data-science team, without artificial barriers from switching from one tool or ecosystem to the other.


## [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org)

Superset provides a very polished environment for exploring data, in many ways comparable to commercial tools like Tableau. With that in mind, see the previous section for the basic ideas about how Superset relates to Lumen, other than not being commercial. Here we'll discuss specific considerations about Superset, since as an open-source Python-heavy tool a given organization may need to decide between Superset and Lumen.

The most obvious difference is that even though Superset is billed as "lightweight", compared to Lumen it is a very heavyweight tool. Superset includes a database that needs installation and management, along with various user management and account features that make it difficult for a single user to install and make use of individually; it's geared more towards departments and companies to install with administers to maintain it. Lumen can easily be installed by an individual user, immediately giving the ability to use text-based specifications to build apps and dashboards, without necessarily requiring the central administrators to agree to support it.

The other major difference specifically with Superset is that Lumen accepts custom-written transform, filter, and view components on the same basis as its own components, letting users and organizations completely control and customize them, while Superset's Python configurability is more limited, focusing on allowing specific bits of customizable behavior implemented just for Superset.


## [Datasette](https://datasette.io)

Like Superset and the commercial packages, Datasette provides a web-based interface for exploring data and selecting values to plot or display in tables. As a more specialized open-source tool, Datasette's UI is not as extensive or polished as the commercial tools, but the functionality provided is nonetheless powerful because it is based anround an underlying relational database.

In contrast, Lumen does not require that the data being processed be inserted into a database, and is thus more similar to working with a [data lake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_lake) than with a database (for both good and bad!). With Lumen, the data remains wherever it was originally located, without necessarily being processed before the app begins, which is a decentralized approach that can be messier but works well for large, remote datasets processed lazily. Because only the required subsets of the data are imported into Lumen), big-data processing tools and workflows like [Datashader](https://datashader.org) can be used, where the data is read as-needed from an efficient file format like [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/). 


## [Perspective](https://perspective.finos.org)

Like the other tools listed above, Perspective provides a GUI interface for selecting dimensions and columns for plots and tables, making it simple to explore columnar data. Like the non-Lumen HoloViz tools, Perspective is usable in Jupyter, which helps integrate configurable analytics into an otherwise custom workflow. Perspective is thus an alternative to Lumen in some cases, but we suggest using both in combination: Use Perspective to design plots, then Lumen for the full workflow consisting of data sources, arbitrary transforms, and laying out the results.
