# Lumen compared to other dashboarding tools

As listed at [pyviz.org/tools](https://pyviz.org/tools.html#dashboarding) and [pyviz.org/dashboarding](https://pyviz.org/dashboarding/), there are many other Python-based open-source tools for building analytics dashboards. There are even more if you consider commercial tools or ones not based on Python, such as the hundreds of listed at [capterra](https://www.capterra.com/dashboard-software/). How can you choose between Lumen and all these other tools?

What sets Lumen apart is that it lets _anyone_ on your team make apps that build on custom Python code, without requiring that _everyone_ learn Python. Lumen is a great choice if you have some people on a team or in an organization who can write custom Python code that does _precisely_ what your organization needs in a particular case, whether that's connecting to some custom data source, applying some custom transform or analysis method, viewing things in some custom chart or type of table, or literally anything else you can do in Python (which is literally anything!). 

Just like traditional BI analytics tools like Tableau, PowerBI, or Superset, Lumen lets non-technical or non-Python users with domain knowledge build visualizations and dashboards that meet their needs. The longer-established BI tools will generally have a more polished and friendly user interface than Lumen has, meeting more of the needs of less-technical users with no coding at all. If those meet your organizations needs, use them!

But what do you do when you reach the limits of those tools? Many of them include Python or other scripting tools for that purpose, but generally as an add-on that's not fully integrated. Unlike those other tools, Lumen itself is built directly on the scientific Python stack, and particularly the Intake and Panel libraries, which (a) provides a very rich basis of functionality to non-technical users comparable to what is available to Python users, and (b) treats custom functionality as a "first class citizen", provided exactly the same way as any of Lumen's native functionality. That way an organization can customize _anything_, with new customizations requiring Python code contributed by the Python experts and then immediately usable by _every_ Lumen user, technical or not.

Lumen and the rest of the HoloViz and scientific Python stack can thus meet _all_ of the needs of an organization, no matter how specialized or esoteric those needs are. Standard BI tools will do a great job at the typical needs, but won't do as well at providing "headroom" or a "release valve" for those rarer but individually important bits that can otherwise dominate a workflow or greatly reduce its effectiveness.
